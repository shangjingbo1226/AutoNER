- **Inference**:
  - **[LightNER](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/LightNER)**: inference w. models pre-trained / trained w. *any* following tools, *efficiently*. 
- **Training**:
  - **[LD-Net](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/LD-Net)**: train NER models w. efficient contextualized representations.
  - **[VanillaNER](https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/Vanilla_NER)**: train vanilla NER models w. pre-trained embedding.
- **Distant Training**:
  - **[AutoNER](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/AutoNER/)**: train NER models w.o. line-by-line annotations and get competitive performance.

## Training

### Required Inputs

- **Tokenized Raw Texts**
  - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/raw_text.txt```
    - One token per line.
    - An empty line means the end of a sentence.
- **Two Dictionaries**
  - **Core Dictionary w/ Type Info**
    - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/dict_core.txt```
      - Two columns (i.e., Type, Tokenized Surface) per line.
      - Tab separated.
    - How to obtain?
      - From domain-specific dictionaries.
  - **Full Dictionary w/o Type Info**
    - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/dict_full.txt```
      - One tokenized high-quality phrases per line.
    - How to obtain? 
      - From domain-specific dictionaries.
      - Applying the high-quality phrase mining tool on domain-specific corpus.
        - [AutoPhrase](https://github.com/shangjingbo1226/AutoPhrase) 
- **Pre-trained word embeddings**
  - Train your own or download from the web.
  - The example run uses ```embedding/bio_embedding.txt```, which can be downloaded from [our group's server](http://dmserv4.cs.illinois.edu/bio_embedding.txt). For example, ```curl http://dmserv4.cs.illinois.edu/bio_embedding.txt -o embedding/bio_embedding.txt```. Since the embedding encoding step consumes quite a lot of memory, we also provide the encoded file in the ```autoner_train.sh```.
- **[Optional]** Development & Test Sets.
  - Example: ```data/BC5CDR/truth_dev.ck``` and ```data/BC5CDR/truth_test.ck```
    - Three columns (i.e., token, ```Tie or Break``` label, entity type).
    - ```I``` is ```Break```.
    - ```O``` is ```Tie```.
    - Two special tokens ```<s>``` and ```<eof>``` mean the start and end of the sentence.

### Dependencies

This project is based on ```python>=3.6```. The dependent package for this project is listed as below:
```
numpy==1.13.1
tqdm
torch-scope
pytorch==0.4.1
```

### Command
